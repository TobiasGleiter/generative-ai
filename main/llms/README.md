# 🎒 Large Language Models

## What are LLMs?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are huge language models pretrained on large amiunts of datasets withput tuning on data for specific tasks.

## What are the state of the art language models out there?

LLMs differ in their traing strategies, model architectures, and uses cases. For a better understanding, LLMs can be categorized into two types: encoder-decoder or encoder-only language models and decoder-only language models. (1)

The reference states some knowledge they possed while studying the llm field:

1. Decoder-only models have been dominating the development of LLMs since 2021 after the release of GPT-3
2. OpenAI consistently maintains its leadership position in LLM, both currently and potentially in future
3. Meta contributes significantly to open-source LLMs and promotes research of LLMs
4. LLMs exhibit a tendency towards closed-sourcing. Before 2020 the majority LLMs were open-sourced. Currently, companies close-sources their models.
5. Encoder-decoder models remain promising.
