# 🧠 Neuronal Network

## 🐋 What is a neuronal network?

The term neuronal network is from the neuro-science. Neuronal networks are the connection between the neurons which is a part of the central nervous system. The computer science tried to imitate this systems from the central nervous system. The neuronal network can work parallel which makes it possible to learn complex not linear dependencies from the orgin information. These complex learning is independent and is based on the previous knowledge. (1)

A neuronal network is therefor a system out of hard- and software which is oriented on the human brain. (1) A neuronal network does have at least free layers in this order:

- Input-Layer
- Hidden-Layer
- Output-Layer

The hidden Layer can be 100, 1000 or more Layers. The system learns (hopefully) from one to the next layer. The neuronal network can look like this:

Each node is assosiated as an own knowledge base. It represents rules that are programmed but also rules which were learned on the training process.
