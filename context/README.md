# ðŸ§¼ Understanding where Generative AI is placed

A brief overview where Generative AI is placed in the AI sector.

## Context

There are currently three big sectors:

- AI (Artificial Intelligence)
- ML (Machine Learning)
- Deep Learning (Deep Learning)

as the Image shows.

### Definition of AI

One definiton is: AI is a discipline as the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normaly **requiring human intelligence** (Google). But what is human intelligence? How can you measure human intelligence? How does our brain work? These are all related questions to the word "intelligence".

A second definition would be "The goal of AI is it to develop machines that behave as do they posess intelligence" (1) but this is not realy precise. A different defintion would be "Artificial Intelligence is the study of how to make computers do things at which, at the moment, people are better." (Rich, 1983) and a third definition would be "AI defines the ability of a machine to perform congnitive tasks, which are accosiated with human sense". (2)

Result: There is no clear definition of AI because we don't even now how to define intelligence right.

### Definition of ML

_ML is a subfield of AI_

_Key words: AI, ML, and Deep Learning form a hierarchy in the world of artificial intelligence._

## Defining AI: Precisely defining "intelligence" proves elusive. Some propose:

- Google's Definition: AI allows machines to perform tasks typically needing human intelligence. But how do we measure this "intelligence"?
- Behavior-Based Definition: Aiming to create machines behaving intelligently, but lacking precision.
  Task-Based Definition: Making computers do what humans currently excel at.
- Cognitive Ability Definition: Machines performing tasks associated with human cognition.

Key Takeaway: The lack of a clear definition for "intelligence" makes defining AI inherently challenging.

## Machine Learning (ML): A subfield of AI.

## Deep Learning
