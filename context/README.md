## ðŸ¤– Artificial Intelligence (AI)

First of all, what is human intelligence? Human intelligence is the combination of speechly intelligence, musically inteligence, logical-mathmatical intelligence, spatial intelligence, physical intelligence, and creating intelligence (Gardner et al. 2011, P 490-498). Die diversity of intelligence does show that it is not easy for a machine to completely pocess all these intelligence. (2)

Therfore AI can be defined as a intelligent behavior to solve problems. Based on this knowledge should a system generate automatically "inteligent" solutions. AI should also find solution that a humans probably not consider. (2)

Besides that definition there are many different textual approaches to define AI.

- The Encyclopedia Britannica defines AI as the ability digital computers or computer controlled robots who solve task that normally require higher intelligence of humans. (3)
- Elaine Rich (1983) defines Artificial Intelligence as the study of how to make computers do things which, at the moment, people are better. (1)(2)

This definition of Elaine Richt is currently and in 50 years one of the best (1). Tasks like executing many calculations in a short amount of time are strength of the computers but react to an unknown circumstance like entering a room and handle if necessary in milliseconds. (1)

This definition of Elaine Rich is not the end. AI will, as other technologies, further developed and get better and better. (1)

## ðŸ§» Machine Learning (ML)

Machine Learning is a Subfield of AI (1) and the AI is moreover a discipline. (Google) Machine Learning can be defined as Program or System that trains a model from input data. The trained model can make useful prediction, therfore Machine Learning gives computers the ability to learn without explicit programming. (Google)

In Machine Learning we can differentiate between:

- Unsupervised learning (UL) which uses unlabelled data
- Supervised learning (SL) which uses labelled data
- Reinforcment learning
- Deep learning using neuronal networks (interconnected notes)
