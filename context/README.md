## ðŸ¤– Artificial Intelligence (AI)

First of all, what is human intelligence? Human intelligence is the combination of speechly intelligence, musically inteligence, logical-mathmatical intelligence, spatial intelligence, physical intelligence, and creating intelligence (Gardner et al. 2011, P 490-498). Die diversity of intelligence does show that it is not easy for a machine to completely pocess all these intelligence. (2)

Therfore AI can be defined as a intelligent behavior to solve problems. Based on this knowledge should a system generate automatically "inteligent" solutions. AI should also find solution that a humans probably not consider. (2)

Besides that definition there are many different textual approaches to define AI.

- The Encyclopedia Britannica defines AI as the ability digital computers or computer controlled robots who solve task that normally require higher intelligence of humans. (3)
- Elaine Rich (1983) defines Artificial Intelligence as the study of how to make computers do things which, at the moment, people are better. (1)(2)

This definition of Elaine Richt is currently and in 50 years one of the best (1). Tasks like executing many calculations in a short amount of time are strength of the computers but react to an unknown circumstance like entering a room and handle if necessary in milliseconds. (1)

This definition of Elaine Rich is not the end. AI will, as other technologies, further developed and get better and better. (1)

## ðŸ§» Machine Learning (ML)

Machine Learning is a Subfield of AI (1) and the AI is moreover a discipline. (Google) Machine Learning uses algorithms that are capable of self-learning. (2) In this case is it necessary to have high quality data. These algorithms dont need any extra coding effort to improve there output - it's called self-daptive algorithms. (2)

In Machine Learning we can differentiate between (4)(5):

- Unsupervised learning (UL) which uses unlabelled data.
  The AI-system already knows the right answers and tries to derive the answer from the data. The task of the algorithmen is in this case known beforehand. (2)
- Supervised learning (SL) which uses labelled data
  The ai-system dont know the aim and tries to detect patterns or similarities. The task of the algorithmen is to detect these patterns independently. (2)
- Reinforcment learning
  In this case the ai-system is trained in an interative tiral and error process were the output is validated as good or bad. (2)
- Deep learning using neuronal networks (interconnected notes)
  A special Subfield of ML is Deep Learning (4)(5)(6)(7). Deep in this case means a huge amout of neuronal networks. Deep Learning can work also with greater depth of dataresources (2)
