# ðŸ§¼ Understanding where Generative AI is placed

A brief overview where Generative AI is placed in the AI sector.

## Context

There are currently three big sectors:

- AI (Artificial Intelligence)
- ML (Machine Learning)
- Deep Learning (Deep Learning)

as the Image shows.

### Definition of AI

One definiton is: AI is a discipline as the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normaly **requiring human intelligence**. (Google) Questions like:

- What is human intelligence?
- How can you measure human intelligence?
- How does our brain work?

A better definition would be "The goal of AI is it to develop machines that behave as do they posess intelligence" (1) but this is not realy precise. A different defintion would be "Artificial Intelligence is the study of how to make computers do things at which, at the moment, people are better." (Rich, 1983) and a third definition would be "AI defines the ability of a machine to perform congnitive tasks, which are accosiated with human sense". (2)

Result: There is no clear definition of AI because we don't even now how to define intelligence right.

### Definition of ML

_ML is a subfield of AI_
