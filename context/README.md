## ðŸ¤– Artificial Intelligence (AI)

First of all, what is human intelligence? Human intelligence is accoring to Gardner et. al. the combination of

- speechly intelligence
- musically inteligence
- logical-mathmatical intelligence
- spatial intelligence
- physical intelligence
- creating intelligence
- and more...

With this knowledge we can try to define Artificial Intelligence (AI) which is associated with Computers that possess human intelligence. One apporach is, that AI can be defined as a intelligent behavior to solve problems. AI should be able find automatically intelligent solutions and possibly sloution were humany didn't think of. (2) Besides this apporach to define AI there are many different other textual approaches to define AI. Three approaches:

- The Encyclopedia Britannica defines AI as the ability digital computers or computer controlled robots who solve task that normally require higher intelligence of humans
- Kreutzer (2019) defines AI as the ability of a maschine to solve kongitive tasks which requres the human intelligence
- Elaine Rich (1983) defines Artificial Intelligence as the study of how to make computers do things which, at the moment, people are better. (1)(2)

The result is, that it is not easy to define the term AI. Elain Rich's definition is one of the simplest and best but this definiton is also not the end. (1) AI will get better at solving tasks that reuqires human intelligence and with the time it gets better and better. (1)

## ðŸ§» Machine Learning (ML)

Machine Learning is a Subfield of AI (1) and the AI is moreover a discipline. (Google) Machine Learning uses algorithms that are capable of self-learning. (2) These self-learning algorithms don't need any extra coding effort to improve there output - it's called self-daptive algorithms. (2) ML is therefore a way to syntecially generate or predict data based on knowlede.

In Machine Learning we can differentiate between for subfield (4)(5):

- Unsupervised learning (UL) which uses unlabelled data.
  The AI-system already knows the right answers and tries to derive the answer from the data. The task of the algorithmen is in this case known beforehand. (2)
- Supervised learning (SL) which uses labelled data
  The ai-system dont know the aim and tries to detect patterns or similarities. The task of the algorithmen is to detect these patterns independently. (2)
- Reinforcment learning
  In this case the ai-system is trained in an interative tiral and error process were the output is validated as good or bad. (2)
- Deep learning using neuronal networks (interconnected notes)
  A special Subfield of ML is Deep Learning (4)(5)(6)(7). Deep in this case means a huge amout of neuronal networks. Deep Learning can work also with greater depth of dataresources (2)
