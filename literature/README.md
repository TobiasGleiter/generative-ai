## üê≥ What Literature did I find and on what topics do they focus (Generative AI)?

First thing I noticed was that there are not "Literature" available on this topic because it is realy new (September 2023). In 2024 I discovered more and more Papers about Generative AI.

Papers with direct links to them:

## ü©≥ Short Paper Review

The paper reviews are realy short with three steps:

1. Introduction: Simple introduction to the reasearch question, topic or statement.
2. Insights: Showing some information from the paper.
3. Result: One sentence, not much information just the key essence of the paper.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ P1, ChatGPT vs. Bard - Which is better at solving coding problems

Introduction: This paper focusing on the coding tasks solving of the two: ChatGPT and BARD (now Gemini, Feb 2024). It addresses Leet Code Problems and tested how the models solved the problems.

Insights: The reasearch did and binary approach of testing the models. A answer was accepted when it passed 95 % of the tests. The paper claims that ChatGPT was in all cases better than BARD. Table 1 does show the results.

Result: ChatGPT did better than BARD in all Leet Code Problems.
