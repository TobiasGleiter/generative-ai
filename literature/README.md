## üê≥ What Literature did I find and on what topics do they focus (Generative AI)?

First thing I noticed was that there are not "Literature" available on this topic because it is realy new (September 2023). In 2024 I discovered more and more Papers about Generative AI.

Papers with direct links to them:
